# PCA and Autoencoder implementation for image denoinsing, image reconstruction, and image segmentation

## `NB1.ipynb`
This notebook contains work done mostly on CIFAR-10 and MNIST dataset. 
### Part-1 
This part is just a CNN-based image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset. The CNN architecutre contains the residual blocks with 47,650 of total parameters ran on 20 epochs and gave the accuracy of 74%. The CNN architecture is as follows:
